# Document labelling

## Background

Fortytwo Technologies principles in regards to information protection and document labelling

This section only focus on **classification** of information based on the informations sensitivity and the intended audience. We will not handle protection of the infomation in this section, protection will build on the label definition, usage guidelines and the systems Fortytwo use. 

## Personal (Purple)

If you - **in special circumstances** - need to use your Fortytwo computer for personal non-related stuff, this label is what you **shall** use
Intended for personal documents and files - wether it is a PowerPoint for an upcoming grand birthday or notes and preparations for exams or presentations. 
What separates Personal from _Fortytwo_ or _Public_ is that we don't track usage of _Personal_ but this should be stored outside of SharePoint Online, like OneDrive or any 3rd party storage services (or locally). 
It is also not covered by any retention policies or data loss prevention policies. There might be a thin line between Personal and Fortytwo - when in doubt, reach out.
