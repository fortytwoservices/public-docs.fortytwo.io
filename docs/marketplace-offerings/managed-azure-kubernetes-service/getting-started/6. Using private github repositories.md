    - Go to the `Settings` section in the left menu.

3. **Connect to Repository**:
    - Click on `Repositories`.
    - Choose `Connect Repo`.
    - Keep the default setting of `Via SSH` in the connection method dropdown.
    - Select the `default` project.
    - Paste your Github Repository URL into the `Repository URL` field. Eg. `https://github.com/fortytwoservices/sampleapps.git`
