## Overview

This guide will help you deploy your workload using Argo CD by creating an application manifest that utilizes secrets from Azure Key Vault and targets your GitHub repository.

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository with your application code.
- Secrets stored in Azure Key vault (if your application requires it).

### Proposed Git structure

- You should have at least two repositories.
    - One repository for your application code. This will include your application backend and frontend.
    - One repository for your Kubernetes manifests and platform specific things. This will include ArgoCD applications, application sets and YAML files.
        - You should split this repository up into logical folders.
            - `apps`: this folder holds all your Kubernetes manifests for your applications.
            - `projects`: this folder holds all your ArgoCD projects, applications and application sets.


    !!! info
        Whatever combination of repositories you prefer is sufficient to follow and complete this guide. 
        
        However, you should opt for a more structured approach for your production workloads.

### Deploy your workloads

1. **Prepare your Application Manifest**:
    - Create your application manifest in your Github repository.
        - Remember to reference the `SecretProviderClass` in your Kubernetes deployment manifests to use secrets from Azure Key Vault.
    - Example application manifest (eg. `busybox.yaml`) located in your Github repository (or any public repository you are using):
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: busybox-secrets-store-deployment
      namespace: workloads
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: busybox-secrets-store
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: busybox-secrets-store
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: busybox
            image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/busybox:1.29-4
            command: ["sleep", "300"]
            volumeMounts:
            - name: secrets-store01-inline
              mountPath: "/mnt/secrets-store"
              readOnly: true
            resources:
              requests:
                memory: "64Mi"
                cpu: "250m"
              limits:
                memory: "128Mi"
                cpu: "500m"
            securityContext:
              allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
              runAsNonRoot: true
              readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
              runAsUser: 65533
            livenessProbe:
              exec:
                command:
                - cat
                - /mnt/secrets-store/secret1
              initialDelaySeconds: 30
              periodSeconds: 10
            readinessProbe:
              exec:
                command:
                - cat
                - /mnt/secrets-store/secret1
              initialDelaySeconds: 5
              periodSeconds: 10
          volumes:
          - name: secrets-store01-inline
            csi:
              driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
              readOnly: true
              volumeAttributes:
                secretProviderClass: "azure-kvname-user-msi" # Change this to reflect your secretProviderClass name if you deviated from the walkthrough
    ```
2. **Prepare the ArgoCD manifest**:
    - Create an application manifest file (e.g., `app.yaml`). Here is a example ArgoCD application that deploys the application manifest above. Copy and run the following code in your terminal:

    ```yaml
      kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
      apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
      kind: Application
      metadata:
        name: busybox-deployment
        namespace: argocd
      spec:
        project: default
        source:
          repoURL: https://github.com/fortytwoservices/sampleapps.git
          path: amesto42/sample/
          targetRevision: HEAD
        destination:
          server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
          namespace: workloads  # Change to match your workload namespace
        syncPolicy:
          automated:
            prune: false
            selfHeal: true
          syncOptions:
            - CreateNamespace=true
    EOF
    ```

    !!! info
        This is just a sample deployment. While it will work if you deploy this, it is deploying a `busybox` image which will fail eventually. You should try deploying your own environment specific workloads instead.

        The example is just to gain an understanding of how the deployment process works in your new platform.

5. **Verify deployment**:
    - You now have two options.
        1. Check the ArgoCD UI in your browser by using the external IP from the argocd-server service. The application tile should be visible in the `Applications` section. Click the application tile if you want to inspect the application and its components further.

        2. Use kubectl to interact with ArgoCD through your terminal/CLI and list the applications in your cluster. You can run the following command to achieve this:
        
            `kubectl get applications --namespace argocd`

        !!! note
            You can fetch the External IP of the ArgoCD server by running the following command:
            
            `kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'`


6. **Verify workload content**
    - As a final step and to verify that the secret you uploaded in the Azure Key vault has been mounted correctly inside your workload in a secure manner. Run the following commands:

        `kubectl exec busybox-secrets-store-deployment -- ls /mnt/secrets-store/`

        `kubectl exec busybox-secrets-store-deployment -- cat /mnt/secrets-store/secret1`
    
### Conclusion

Your application is now deployed using Argo CD, with secrets securely managed by Azure Key Vault and code hosted in a GitOps way on GitHub.
